Entry for Ludum Dare 33 Compo
by Sean Miller

## Monster Arena ##
This is a super satirical game about being a can of Monster energy drink. I myself have nothing to do with Monster and do not represent the views of Monster Energy.
I doubt they do condone pushing sleeping people off of raised arenas though.

## Controls ##

* WASD or arrow keys to move
* mouse to rotate
* left-click to spray (and choose menu options)

## Tips/Info ##

There is volume control and a music on/off switch in the menu once you get into the actual play.

Everything here was coded with lua and rendered with love2d.
MSPaint was used for all the graphics.
Sounds and music were made completely a capella by me.

Move using wasd or the arrow keys, rotate using the mouse, spray using left-click, charge the spray by moving rapidly or rotating rapidly.
There are 5 levels overall and the amount of enemies gets a little crazy, so things may bog down in later levels...

## The Code ##
The code is available on [github](https://github.com/mooglesensei/monsterrevivening) with the MIT License.
To run the code you need to have [Love2d](www.love2d.org) version 0.9.2 or greater (although greater has not been tested).
For Linux users, provided that Love2d is on you path you can simply run `love /path/to/folder` and that will start the game.
